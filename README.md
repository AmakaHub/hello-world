# hello-world
Let's do this! Been using other people's github accounts for about a year. Time to step up with the big girls!

Hi People,
This is likely the most public i'll ever be, but for the sake of GitHub, I'm all in!  I'm sort of a STEMinista on steroids.  I love science, data, math, statistics, numbers, letters, programming, software, downloads, research, teaching, explaining, showing, lightbulbs going off/on, sharing, visualizing, should I go on???
